              Imagine a curious five-year-old, wide-eyed and eager, encountering their 
              first computer â€“ a Windows 95, if you can believe it! That child was me, 
              and from that moment, I was hooked on technology. From gaming to schoolwork 
              and eventually, professional projects, I've journeyed through different 
              operating systems, honing my technical skills along the way.

            While my academic journey began in film and visual media, earning an Associates 
            in Sound Media Arts, my passion for technology never faded. For three thrilling 
            years, I freelanced on various film projects, mastering audio manipulation in 
            Pro Tools and Logic. Yet, the desire for new challenges drove me to seek additional 
            training.

            Enter the Southern California Institute of Technology (SCIT) in 2018, where I 
            discovered my fascination with PLCs (Programmable Logic Computers). This newfound 
            interest propelled me into the world of computer programming.

            Post-graduation, I dove into electrical work, sharpening my problem-solving skills. 
            However, the allure of coding persisted. As I delved deeper, web development 
            captured my imagination. In 2020, amidst global turmoil, I seized the opportunity 
            to immerse myself fully in web development. From YouTube and Udemy tutorials to endless 
            cups of coffee, I honed my coding skills and crafted visually captivating software.

            My coding journey has been transformative, leading to diverse projects from games 
            to weather applications. Now, armed with a proven track record and boundless enthusiasm, 
            I'm ready to bring my passion and expertise to your team.</p>
